==================================================

netkit-ftp is the original file transfer client program for Linux. While netkit-ftp is no longer maintained, it is still included in various Linux distributions and has the dubious distinction of being the [riskiest](https://twitter.com/MikeMaraya/status/673568298148212736) open source application according to the Linux Foundation. The purpose of this project is to identify and mitigate the weaknesses in netkit-ftp and update Linux distributions that still carry it. If you are looking for a modern and safer FTP client, consider [lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru).

The original README for netkit-ftp 0.17 can be found [here](README).
